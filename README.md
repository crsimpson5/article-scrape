# mongo-scraper

### What is this app?

This app scrapes news articles and allows users to comment on them. 

### How does it work?

The articles and comments are saved using MongoDB and Mongoose. Each comment is associated with the article it was posted to. The routing is handled through Express, and pages are rendered using Handlebars.
